# AnyCard
Simple, ugly iOS app for simulating a deck of index cards (for tabletop game prototyping).

This was developed in one night to assist with an upcoming tabletop game playtest, 
and was never intended for general use.
The code is rough, unmaintained, and probably buggy. Use at your own risk!
